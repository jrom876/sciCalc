# sciCalc
A simple, expandable user interface (UI) written in C for calculating various scientific values of use to the RF Hardware Engineer.

To make (update and recompile dependencies), type:

      make -f mc.mk

To run the main user interface, type:

      ./main
      
Please do not use the bpf2Calc and bpf3Calc files until further notice.

This app is in early development and still needs lots of work, but it is still quite functional. 

Feel free to branch off and fix stuff.
