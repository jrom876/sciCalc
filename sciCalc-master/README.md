# sciCalc
A simple, expandable user interface (UI) written in C for calculating various scientific values of use to the RF Hardware Engineer.

To make (update and recompile dependencies), type:

      make -f mc.mk

To run the main user interface, type:

      ./main
      

This app is in continuous development and needs work here and there, but it is still quite functional. 

Feel free to branch off and fix stuff.
